## Some quite interesting open source projects
🥠 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/developer-fortune-cookies">developer-fortune-cookies</a><br>
Fortune cookies for developers. A simple and clean Angular web application built using TailwindCSS. Open it, copy it or export it, repeat. Try it <a href="https://ilmalte.github.io/developer-fortune-cookies/">here!</a>

📱 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/flutter_fortune_cookies">flutter_fortune_cookies</a><br>
Fortune cookies for developers. A way too simple flutter application I developed with the aim of starting to learn Flutter.

🚀 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/github-actions-with-sqlite">github-actions-with-sqlite</a><br>
A test of sqlite, Github Actions and Github Pages. A Github Action adds random records on a sqlite db every 6 hours. Then a Typescript page, compiled in WebAssembly, displays data randomly using sql.js-httpvfs (a wrapper around sql.js to provide a read-only HTTP-Range-request based virtual file system for SQLite).

📖 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/quick-dictionary-bot">quick-dictionary-bot</a><br>
A web scraper Telegram bot written in Python. I have written a <a class="project sublink" href="../posts/web-scarper-telegram-bot-python/">post</a> about it so that you can better understand how it works and also build it by your own.

🌐 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/wsdl-downloader">wsdl-downloader</a><br>
A C# console application. I have implemented a feature to download WSDL files from a csv. Supposed to be a PR but now it is a project standalone.

📚 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/wikisummary">wikisummary</a><br>
My first open source code ever. A Telegram bot written in Node.js that given a word provides you a summary of the related Wikipedia page.

📖 <a class="project" href="https://github.com/ilmalte/una-scatola-di-libri">una-scatola-di-libri</a><br>
Landing page I've built to support tiny bookshops in Italy collecting orders during COVID-19.
During the pandemic, indipendent bookstores were suffering because they mostly base their business on a brick and mortar model.
It remained nothing but a POC because after validating the idea with booksellers we realized margins were too low because of shipping costs. The proof of concept is still accessible <a href="https://una-scatola-di-libri.netlify.app/">here!</a>
