## WHY I DECIDED TO START A BLOG
Some months ago I subscribed to a *shared web hosting service* for no reason, just to act cool. It is about a web hosting service where many websites reside on one single web server connected to the Internet. This is generally the cheapest option for hosting but of course it has huge limitations.

In less than three weeks I've understood that a shared web hosting service is not the best plan for a developer who wants to have fun learning new things by having the full control of his server. So I decided to unsubscribe to this service and I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 that finally allows me to develop my projects with full control of my server.

At this point my unique problem is my tendency to procrastinate that prevents me from developing any side project. To avoid the struggle I got I decided to start a blog. I was thinking about how many ideas come into my mind everyday and how much I would like to share them with someone. But, of course, no one of my twenty-years-old friends care about my Python side projects etc.

I was not really into spending too much time and energy in developing a blog platform by myself in PHP or simply using a CMS like WordPress or Drupal for a blog that undoubtedly no one will read. So I started to look for more suitable alternatives. 

That's when I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), and some other interesting solutions but finally I decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## WHY I DECIDED TO USE HUGO
As [this article](https://flaviocopes.com/start-blog-with-hugo/) states: Hugo is **simple**, **boring**, **flexible**, **fast**.

Essentially, to start a blog with Hugo you do not need neither to spend time programming a blog platform from zero or to spend time struggling with WordPress or similar. And that's actually an incredible thing because it lets you concentrate on just think about the *most important* thing, the *content*.

Additionally, Hugo is *incredibly fast*. It's written in **Go** and things are made to be as quick as possible.

I decided to deploy my Hugo blog on Netlify using continuous deployment and I have to admit that it's awesome, I just have towrite an article in markdown with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), I commit it to my private repository and in less than ten seconds my website is updated!

Netlify offers a free plan interesting for hosting personal projects, hobby sites, or experiments and in this way I can stop paying for my shared web hosting service and just pay for a custom domain.
